Use Struct functionality in Cadence Flow to store data of employee in dictionary

This Flow program is a simple program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the struct in cadence programming language. The purpose of this program is to show how to use struct in cadence to write a smart contract.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in cadence, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the flow blockchain. The contract has a single function that add new employees to dictionary employees which contains employee address as a key and employee information as value. Struct is used to store information of the individual employee.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use play.flow, an online cadence IDE. To get started, go to the flow website at (https://play.flow.com/)

Once you are on the Flow website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar of a contract. Save the file with a .cdc extension (e.g., Employee.cdc). And add Employee.cdc file.

To add transaction add create a new file by clicking "+" icon in transaction tab. Save the file .cdc extension.
Also follow same for script add ReadEmployee.cdc file in script
```

If no error you can deploy the code by clicking on deploy in contract Tab and select the user in which you have to deploy the code.

Once the code is contract is deployed, you can modify the values of contract by sending ask inputs in transaction tab and click on send button. 

To read employee info of particular employee you send address of employee which you have

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the sayHello function. Click on the "HelloWorld" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the "sayHello" function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the "Hello World!" message.
